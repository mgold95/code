# Subroutines

Hello there. Here for you is a collection of LC3 subroutines I have written to make your life easier. I try to add these as I create them for various MPs or labs because reuse of code is an awesome thing. Why reinvent the wheel every time you write an MP?

Obviously, you are free to use these snippets of code. They were written by me and are therefore my work and I am open sourcing them for your convenience. I would ask that you leave the header comment though because that's kind of like citing your source so you don't get accused of plagiarism or something of that nature.

Needless to say, if you are accused of cheating or something for using these subroutines, I am not in any way responsible. You should check with your professor first.

If you do choose to use this code, please use it in accordance with the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

Thanks.

Happy coding.
