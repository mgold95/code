# LC3 Sucks

We all know it's true.

I'm not here to help you cheat on ECE-120 or ECE-220. Sorry. However, if you hate LC3 and wish it had some more freaking useful opcodes, I can help with that.

I have open-sourced several subroutines I have created to make LC3 less of a pain in the ass. I have also created some tests for various labs/mps which you are more than welcome to use to ensure your code functions as expected.

As with all other code in my `code` repo, all code is open-sourced under the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). I encourage you to take full advantage of the code I offer, but read the license and abide by it!

Happy coding fellas and I wish you all the best.
